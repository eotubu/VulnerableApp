### Why VulnerableApp

There are many tools for finding Web Application Vulnerability like [ZAP](https://github.com/zaproxy), Burp etc but while contributing to these Open Source Tools 
it is very tough to check if the Payloads added or Scripts added are working as expected.

### What used to be the solution

1. Tool developers had to manually write applications that are prone to separate security flaws 
that the tool they are developing is able to flag.
2. Slog it out with unit tests

### Why would the above not work 

Approach 1: Tool developers have to focus on ways to crash test their apps, which is cumbersome 
as each might have to develop their own versions of a flawed web-app, which are not reviewed 
and debugging those apps might quickly become overwhelming.

Approach 2: Simulating every scenario using unit tests are not feasible.

### What we propose
#### The [VulnerableApp](https://github.com/SasanLabs/VulnerableApp):

1. A simple web app built on top of the popular Spring framework
2. Docker ready, can simply fire up the image and we are good to go
3. Fully extensible, annotation and path based vulnerability execution
4. Simple integration with security tools since VulnerableApp exposes REST APIs
5. Developed from experience gathered collaborating for ZAP

Other Benefits :-

1. Going further it will become a Bank of Vulnerabilities and hence can be used as a platform for learning Web Application Security
2. It can also become a very good benchmarking platform to compare between multiple releases and across various scanning tools.
3. Scanners can follow the practise of writing a Vulnerability first before exposing it using scanner something like a TDD approach.

This Application is deliberately vulnerable to attacks so that users can learn not only about attacks and attack vectors but also about securing Web Applications against those attacks.
